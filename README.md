Project Summary:
EasyMeal is a seamless, easy-to-use, online menu that will allow users to place orders and select delivery options from select restaurants. Meal options will be presented in a typical menu format with occasional pictures of the most popular items.
Target Audience:
The target audience is for diners-to-go who need fast, convenient options for food delivery.
Key Features will include: 
Fully functioning menu 
Ability to “Add to cart” an item 
Ability to set quantities if ordering the same item 
Input box for name, address, credit card, etc. 
Ability to add tip to final order

Iteration 2 Update:

User stories that were completed this section include a functional sample menu that covers the name, price, calories, and unit amount of the particular dish that remains in stock. Tip and tax functionality was added, along with printed menu options.  A user can now add items to a cart.  Lastly a shell script was created to assist with running the program and minor code reformatting was completed.

In the next iteration, we are planning to allow the user to add different quantities of items to the cart, remove an item from the cart, and get the total number of calories of all the items inside the cart.  We will finalize the main method to allow a user to submit an order.

To run the code, open command prompt and cd to project directory, then type:
bash ./menu.sh

This command will start the program. A list of menu options can be printed by following instructions in the program.
