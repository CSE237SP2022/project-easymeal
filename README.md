Project Summary:
EasyMeal is a seamless, easy-to-use, online menu that will allow users to place orders and select delivery options from select restaurants. Meal options will be presented in a typical menu format with occasional pictures of the most popular items.
Target Audience:
The target audience is for diners-to-go who need fast, convenient options for food delivery.
Key Features will include: 
Fully functioning menu 
Ability to “Add to cart” an item 
Ability to set quantities if ordering the same item 
Input box for name, address, credit card, etc. 
Ability to add tip to final order

Iteration 1 Update:

User stories that were completed this section include a sample menu that covers the name, price, calories, and unit amount of the particular dish that remains in stock. Additionally, we added the ability to add/remove items from the cart, and get total price, calories (for health-conscious customers), and quantity of all the items ordered.

In the next iteration, we are planning to add a functioning input box where customers can put their name, address, payment info, etc. to complete the online ordering process, as well as accounting for tax and tips. We will also work on developing the menu further to expand meal options and make it feel more authentic. We will aim to fix any unforeseen bugs as well from the first iteration.

As of our last trial, the user stories functioned as planned when tested and others are in progress. Main method still in test phase. We are awaiting feedback from other groups to see if they notice any problems.

To run the code, open command prompt and cd to the directory where project is stored (likely Downloads), then type:
javac MainMethod.java (creates MainMethod class)
java MainMethod.java (compiles and runs the code)

javac can also be used towards other java files.
