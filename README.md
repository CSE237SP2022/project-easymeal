Project Summary:
EasyMeal is a seamless, easy-to-use, online menu that will allow users to place orders and select delivery options from select restaurants. Meal options will be presented in a typical menu format with occasional pictures of the most popular items.
Target Audience:
The target audience is for diners-to-go who need fast, convenient options for food delivery.
Key Features will include:   
Fully functioning menu  
Ability to “Add to cart” an item  
Ability to set quantities if ordering the same item   
Ability to add tip to final order

Iteration 3 Update:

User stories that were completed this section include a fully functional menu, along with test cases added for our main method.  A user can now also add a tip to their order.  Our shell script was updated to provide a cleaner interface and has been tested to not crash (on MacOS).  Code reformatting and javadoc comments were also added this iteration. 

Several bugs were addressed this iteration as mentioned during user testing.  The program should not crash anymore if input is invalid, and the shell script has been tested to compile and run correctly.
To run the code, open command prompt and cd to project directory, then type:
<code>bash ./menu.sh</code>

Note: when you get permission denied (e.g. zsh: permission denied: ./menu.sh) please enter:
<code>bash chmod 700 menu.sh 
And then enter <code>bash ./menu.sh</code>

This command will start the program. A list of menu options can be printed by following instructions in the program.
